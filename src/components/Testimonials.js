                    The food that was prepared was fantastic and I heard a lot of good comments as I was moving around.
                    The presentation was also very impressive.

                    Please thank your team for their professional, efficient and friendly service on Sat night. The
                    chefs smashed it and the drinks flowed freely! Everyone was impressed and were quite taken with how
                    cost effective it was.
